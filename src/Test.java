        Write a code that asks user to if they would like join your classes
        If the answer is "Yes" from user,then ask user information; firstName, lastName, age, gender, class to join
        ***If user is age is not more than 20, do not allow them to join
        ***If user wants to join any other class except Math and Science, do not allow them to join

        REMEMBER - checkAge and checkClassName methods may throw exceptions. You have to handle them

        Keep asking users the question they would to like join until you have got 3 students overall
        Create MathStudent or ScienceStudent objects based on user's answer for the class they want to join
        Print a "Congratulations! You are registered for {className} class."

        Store all these 3 objects in a collection and print them

        EXPECTED OUTPUT OF THE PROGRAM:
        Print information of all 3 students
        Print how many students are MathStudent with message -> "Math students = {numberOfMathStudents}"
        Print how many students are ScienceStudent with message -> "Science students = {numberOfScienceStudents}"
